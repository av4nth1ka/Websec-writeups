+ So, when we give something in the field, will will get the following as output
+ `Here is the hash of your flag: 7c00249d409a91ab84e3f421c193520d9fb3674b`
+ So we need to generate some hashes which starts with 7c00.
+ 
```import hashlib
import base64 
import string
i = 0 
for i in range(20000000): 
    res=hashlib.sha1(str(i).encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()[:4]
    if(res=="7c00"): 
        print(str(i))
```
The code above is a Python program that iterates through integers from 0 to 19,999,999 (i.e., the range of 20000000), and applies the SHA-1 cryptographic hash function to each integer, encoded in UTF-8 format.
The program then takes the first four characters of the hexadecimal digest generated by the hash function using slicing and checks if it matches the string "7c00". If a match is found, the program prints the corresponding integer value as a string to the console.
We get a lot of strings which satisfies the condition. We can use any one of them as the input and get the flag
